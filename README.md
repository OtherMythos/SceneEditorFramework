# Scene Editor Framework

A framework to facilitate editing scenes in the avEngine.

Features include:
 * Fully editable scene tree for avEngine scene files
 * Flexible GUI dialogs for interaction
 * Scene gizmos for editing

## Loading

Add the plugin directory to the project's `Plugins` array in `avSetup.cfg`:

```json
"Plugins": [ "res://sceneEditorFramework" ]
```

The engine reads `avPlugin.cfg` and loads `src/SceneEditorFramework.nut`, which defines all framework
objects in the `::SceneEditorFramework` namespace. Projects must not load that file themselves.
The plugin automatically registers its `res` directory, which contains the gizmo meshes.

## Tests

The unit and integration tests use the avEngine test runner:

```bash
python3 ~/Documents/avTools/testRunner/testRunner.py \
    -p ~/Documents/repo/SceneEditorFramework/test/avTests.cfg \
    -e ~/Documents/avEngine/build/Debug/av.app/Contents/MacOS/av
```
